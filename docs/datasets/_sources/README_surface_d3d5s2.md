## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This dataset is organized in a nested directory structure according to certain useful attributes of the QEC memory experiments:
```
dataset_dir
├── sample_dir
│   ├── patch_dir
│   │   ├── basis_dir
│   │   │   ├── cycles_dir
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The `dataset_dir` contains subdirectories for each sample, named `sample_00`, `sample_01`, etc. A single such sample can be thought of as a collection of QEC data acquired in one experiment.

*In some experiments, the device was well calibrated, while in others the calibrations have not been refreshed for several days. This selection is intended for testing the decoding algorithms under a wide range of experimental conditions.*

The `sample_dir` contains subdirectories for different surface code patches:

![patches](patches.png)

A patch corresponds to a particular set of qubits involved in the code. It is characterized by the code distance and its spatial location on the grid of qubits. The naming convention is chosen to indicate the code distance and the location of the center qubit of the patch.

The `patch_dir` contains subdirectories corresponding to different bases in which the logical qubit is prepared and measured. In this dataset, we have  bases `X` and `Z`. Note that the `X` or `Z` basis is an arbitrary designation for the [XZZX surface code](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22274-1) used here. For each patch, one can inspect the corresponding `circuit_ideal.stim` file (described below), and more specifically, the `OBSERVABLE_INCLUDE` and `QUBIT_COORDS` annotations to determine the protected observable.

The `basis_dir` contains subdirectories for the number of QEC cycles (rounds) in each particular memory experiment: `r05`, `r10`, etc.

At this final depth (corresponding to a particular sample, patch, basis, and number of cycles), we store the actual data organized as described in the next section. This data, when decoded, results in a single point in the figure that shows the decay of the expectation value of the logical observable (in this case, `Z` observable):

___
```

├── circuit_ideal.stim
...
```
The QEC circuit, including annotations describing how detection events are computed from the measurement record and what the logical observable is.

Stored in `stim` circuit format, see [The Stim Circuit File Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/file_format_stim_circuit.md).
___

├── circuit_noisy_si1000.stim

```
The noisy version of the QEC circuit with [SI1000](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-12-20-605/) circuit error model.
___
```
...
├── measurements.b8
...
```
The actual measurement data collected from the device. The detection event data and observable flip data is derived from this data.

Stored in `b8` format, see [The b8 Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md#b8). In the parsing function, the `bits_per_shot` argument should be the total number of measurements in the circuit. Each shot's data is byte aligned by padding up to a multiple of 8 bits. Bits are packed into bytes in little endian order.
___
```
...
├── sweep_bits.b8
...
```
Circuit configuration data, describing which sweep bits were set in each shot. Specifically, the sweep bits are used to initialize the data qubits into different patterns of 0s and 1s. These bits determine whether instructions like `CX sweep[0] 5` in the circuit file are turned into an `X` gate or `I` gate on qubit 5.  Detection event data and observable flip data is derived from this data.

Stored in `b8` format, see [The b8 Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md#b8). In the parsing function, the `bits_per_shot` argument should be the number of sweep bits in the circuits, which can be determined from `circuit_ideal.stim`. Each shot's data is byte aligned by padding up to a multiple of 8 bits. Bits are packed into bytes in little endian order.
___
```
...
├── detection_events.b8
...
```
Detection event data, describing which detectors flipped and did not flip in each QEC shot. The detection event data is used by the decoders to predict whether or not the logical observable was flipped. The bits in every shot should be interpreted as `0` meaning "detector was not flipped" and `1` meaning "detector was flipped".

Stored in `b8` format, see [The b8 Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md#b8). In the parsing function, the `bits_per_shot` argument should be the number of detectors in the circuit, which can be determined from `circuit_ideal.stim`. Each shot's data is byte aligned by padding up to a multiple of 8 bits. Bits are packed into bytes in little endian order.
___
```
...
├── obs_flips_actual.b8
...
```
Observable flip data, indicating if the observable was flipped compared to what it would have been if the circuit had executed noiselessly. The bits in every shot should be interpreted as `0` meaning "observable was not flipped" (i.e. the observed result agreed with the result that would occur if there was no noise) and `1` meaning "observable was flipped".

This is the data that decoders are supposed to predict, hence the subscript `_actual` as opposed to `_predicted`.

Stored in `b8` format, see [The b8 Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md#b8). In the parsing function, the `bits_per_shot` argument should be the number of observables in the circuit, which in this dataset is always 1.
___
```
...
├── metadata.json
...
```
Contains additional information for convenience. The `json` dictionary includes:
1. Basis in which the logical qubit is prepared and measured
2. Code distance
3. Number of QEC cycles
4. Number of QEC shots
5. Coordinates of the "data qubits"
6. Coordinates of the "measure qubits", i.e. auxiliary qubits used to measure the stabilizers

```
A directory containing the decoding results. Each decoding pathway resides in the separate subdirectory. The pathways typically differ from each other in the choice of the decoder or the error model.

The detector error model (DEM) `error_model.dem` can be used as a prior to configure a decoder. It represents error mechanisms as hyperedges in a weighted hypergraph where nodes correspond to detectors. Error mechanisms that set off more than two detectors also contain suggested decompositions into edge-like errors (errors with at most two detectors).

Stored in `dem` format, see [The Detector Error Model File Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/file_format_dem_detector_error_model.md).

The `obs_flips_predicted.b8` file contains the observable flips predicted by the decoder. The bits in every shot should be interpreted as `0` meaning "observable was not flipped" (i.e. the observed result agreed with the result that would occur if there was no noise) and `1` meaning "observable was flipped". Whether a logical error occurred or not in any given shot can be determined by computing an XOR of this data with `obs_flips_actual.b8` data.

Stored in `b8` format, see [The b8 Format](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md#b8). In the parsing function, the `bits_per_shot` argument should be the number of observables in the circuit, which in this dataset is always 1.

## Usage examples <a name="usage-examples"></a>

### Example 1

`detection_events.b8` and `obs_flips_actual.b8` can be derived from the `measurements.b8` and `sweep_bits.b8` with the following Stim command:

    # Assumes a linux-like command line environment.
    # Assumes a python environment with stim 1.9+ installed.
    # Assumes your working directory is the relevant sample directory.

    stim m2d \
        --circuit circuit_ideal.stim \
        --in measurements.b8 \
        --in_format b8 \
        --sweep sweep_bits.b8 \
        --sweep_format b8 \
        --out detection_events.b8 \
        --out_format b8 \
        --obs_out obs_flips_actual.b8 \
        --obs_out_format b8

### Example 2

Here we illustrate the decoding workflow with an open-source [PyMatching](https://github.com/oscarhiggott/PyMatching) decoder and a simple [SI1000](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-12-20-605/) circuit error model which mimics the hierarchy of physical error rates in superconducting qubits.


First, we create a directory for this decoding pathway:

    # Assumes a linux-like command line environment.
    # Assumes your working directory is the relevant sample directory.

    pymatching_dir="decoding_results/pymatching_decoder_with_si1000_prior"
    mkdir $pymatching_dir

Detector error model can be extracted from the noisy Stim circuit as follows:

    # Assumes a python environment with stim 1.9+ installed.

    stim analyze_errors \
        --in circuit_noisy_si1000.stim \
        --out $pymatching_dir/error_model.dem

Finally, the data can be decoded with PyMatching as follows:

    # Assumes a python environment with pymatching 2.0+ installed.

    pymatching predict \
        --dem $pymatching_dir/error_model.dem \
        --in detection_events.b8 \
        --in_format b8 \
        --out $pymatching_dir/obs_flips_predicted.b8 \
        --out_format b8
